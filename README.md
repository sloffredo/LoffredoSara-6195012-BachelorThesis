# LoffredoSara-6195012-BachelorThesis

## Purpose of the repository

This repository was created by Sara Loffredo as part of a BA thesis in Digital Society submitted at Maastricht University in 2022. The repository contains data sets (YouTube) comments and distant reading visualisations created with <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/">Voyant Tools</a>. The YouTube comments per video have been uploaded in EXCEL format and need to be downloaded ("view raw") option before viewing.

## Abstract of BA thesis

"This thesis aims to further understand the role of closeness and the relationships between YouTube influencers and their followers by investigating users' reactions to influencers promoting genderless skincare products via YouTube videos. Specifically, the research focuses on the comments users post under YouTubers' videos that spread inaccurate information; it seeks to understand the bond influencers have established with their community, and whether it impacts the overall perception of the product endorsed. The method used for this research is a quantitative distant reading approach combined with qualitative close reading one, analyzing the comments under nine videos of American influencers with verified accounts. Three main categories emerged when collecting the data: “Do It Yourself,” “Black Masks,” and “Melanotan II.” After exporting each video's comments to Excel using Netlytic, I used Voyant tools to perform distant and close reading combined, thus literary interpretation of the comments and thematic analysis. Among the findings of this research, users find valuable practices such as skin care product reviews, tutorials, or test videos that show the product's use and efficacy in people they follow. Finally, this study's theoretical and social implications are presented as limitations and suggestions for future research."
